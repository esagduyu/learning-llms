# learning-llms
My attempt at recreating some ML learnings as I try to learn how to build LLMs from scratch.

Initially I will be going through Karpathy's YouTube lecture series called [Neural Networks: Zero to Hero](https://github.com/karpathy/nn-zero-to-hero/tree/master). We will see how far I will get...

*(also using this as an excuse to set up [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/) on my Desktop PC and learning how to use GPU acceleration on it)*
